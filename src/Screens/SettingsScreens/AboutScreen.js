        Willows opened in August 2020 with one goal in mind: providing an
        enjoyable relaxed cosy coffee house experience to the people of
        Basingstoke. Thanks to our dedication and hard work, weâ€™ve managed to
        bring a smile as well as gorgeous food and drink to our customers. We're
        dog friendly too, as after all Willows is named after the owners very
